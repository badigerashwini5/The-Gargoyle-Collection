				<h4>What can you do with a gargoyle?</h4>
					Don't think you need a gargoyle? Think again. Gargoyles are useful as:
                        <ul>
							<li>Bird baths</li>
							<li>Bookends</li>
							<li>Paperweights</li>
							<li>Pen holders</li>
							<li>Wind chimes</li>
                        </ul>

					<p>	This month's artist is Michael Cassini. Michael has been a 
						professional sculptor for twenty years. He has won numerous awards, 
						including the prestigious <i>Reichsman Cup</i> and an Award of 
						Merit at the 2012 Tuscany Arts Competition.
					</p>
                                       
					<p>	Michael specializes in recreations of gargoyles from European 
						cathedrals. You'll usually find Michael staring intently at the 
						church walls in northern France. His work is represented by the 
						<i>Turin Gargoyle</i>, a great addition to our Gargoyle 
						Collection.

                           Collection. I'm really excited about this new set of 
                           classical figures.
                        </p>
                        <p>The collection contains faithful reproductions of gargoyles 
                           from some of the famous cathedrals of Europe, including 
                           Notre Dame, Rheims, and Warwick Castle. All reproductions 
                           are done to exacting and loving detail.
                        </p>
                        <p>The collection also contains original works by noted artists 
                           such as Susan Bedford and Antonio Salvari. Our expert artisans 
                           have produced some wonderful and whimsical works, perfectly 
                           suited for home or garden use.
                        </p>
                        <p>Don't delay, order your gargoyle today.
